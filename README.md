Improved website of personal-groceries.

## List of improvements

- replaced horticultural dingbat with leaf emoji to indicate organics
- added more emoji to liven up and provide visuals to help people recognize what to click


## In-Progress

- [stretched link over card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/utilities/stretched-link/)

Make card clickable as effort to make app more accessible to people with mobility issues. Goal: not needing to click small checkbox to add items to cart.
